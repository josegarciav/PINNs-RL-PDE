# PINNs-RL-PDE

A final thesis project on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

## Overview

This project combines the power of Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Reinforcement Learning to solve complex PDEs. It implements a research framework for:

- Solving various types of PDEs with physics-informed loss functions
- Using reinforcement learning for adaptive selection of collocation points
- Comparing different neural network architectures for solving PDEs
- Visualizing and analyzing results interactively

## Project Description  
This final thesis project explores the integration of **Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to improve the selection of collocation points in solving **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**.  
By dynamically adapting collocation points, we aim to enhance convergence speed, reduce error rates, and improve generalization across different PDEs.
