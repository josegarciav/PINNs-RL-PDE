# PINNs-RL-PDE  
**Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Collocation in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).**  

## Project Description  
This project explores the integration of **Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to improve the selection of collocation points in solving **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**.  
By dynamically adapting collocation points, we aim to enhance convergence speed, reduce error rates, and improve generalization across different PDEs.
